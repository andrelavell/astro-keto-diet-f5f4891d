## Introduction
The ketogenic diet, commonly known as the keto diet, emphasizes low carbohydrate intake and high fat consumption to promote weight loss and improve overall health. As you embark on this journey, having a repertoire of satisfying recipes can make all the difference. This article explores delicious keto recipes spanning various meal types, ensuring that every craving is satisfied while staying within the guidelines of the diet.

## Key Principles of the Keto Diet
Before diving into recipes, it's essential to understand the key principles of the keto diet:

- **Low Carbohydrate Intake**: Typically, the diet restricts carbohydrate intake to about 20-50 grams per day.
- **High Fat Consumption**: Healthy fats make up approximately 70-75% of total daily caloric intake.
- **Moderate Protein**: Protein intake should be moderate, around 20-25% of daily calories.
